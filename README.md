# ☕ Bright Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

This repository contains a complete end-to-end data analysis project for Bright Coffee Shop. The goal is to understand sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends across the store branches, and to provide data-driven recommendations to support strategic decision-making at an executive level.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to provide meaningful insights into the performance of Bright Coffee Shop by examining its sales patterns, revenue trends, customer behavior, and product-level contribution to overall business outcomes.

Beyond simply reporting numbers, this analysis aims to *understand the story* behind the data — how customers interact with the brand, which products are driving value, and how store performance varies across different locations and time periods.

This project follows a realistic business intelligence workflow:

1. Raw data extraction  
2. Cleaning and preparation  
3. Exploratory and diagnostic analysis  
4. Visualization and storytelling  
5. Strategic recommendations  

Ultimately, the goal is not only to show *what* is happening in the business, but *why* it is happening — and *what decisions leadership can make* to drive growth.
